## Building

Commands for building can be found in `package.json` under `scripts`. Argument of `-p always` will publish the build as a release to your repository.

### Windows - Public Release
- Create a [Personal Access Token](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-personal-access-token-for-the-command-line/)
- In Windows, set an Environmental variable in PowerShell with the following command, replacing "YOUR_TOKEN" with the token you generated above: `[Environment]::SetEnvironmentVariable("GH_TOKEN","YOUR_TOKEN","User")` - You may need to restart after running this.
- `npm pack` - Pack the applications
- `npm run-script build-win` - Build applications and publish draft to release of your applications repo.

### Windows - Local Build
- In `package.json` - Change `"build-win": "build --win --ia32 -p always",` to `"build-win": "build --win --ia32",`
- `npm pack` - Pack the applications
- `npm run-script build-win` - Build applications and publish draft to release of your applications repo.
- Inside of the `/dist` directory should an executable with your application.

### Linux / macOS - Local Build

- **Linux:** `npm run-script build-linux` - Build applications and publish draft to release of your applications repo.
- **macOS:** `npm run-script build-mac` - Build applications and publish draft to release of your applications repo.
